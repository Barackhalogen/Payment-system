[Autumn](https://useautumn.com) is an open-source layer between Stripe and your application, allowing you to create any pricing model and embed it within minutes. On Autumn you can build:
- Subscriptions
- Credit systems & top ups
- Usage-based models & overages
- Custom plans for large customers

All this without having to handle webhooks, upgrades/downgrades, cancellations or payment fails.
